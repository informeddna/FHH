Steps to perform release.
=========================
1.  Check out latest code that you want to release and make sure you have no local modifications.
2.  Make sure Jira is in order with all issues in the release you want to tag marked resolved and
all other issues moved out of the release.
3.  verify that the app passes all tests by running:
mvn clean install site verify
4.  Verify that your ~/.m2 directory has a settings.xml file with the needed user name and password
to deploy to the mvn repo.
5.  run {code} mvn release:prepare -DpreparationGoals="clean install" {code} providing all information when asked.  You should usually be able to
accept the defaults for everything except the tag.  Our tag naming scheme is slightly different than
the default.  Look at the repositories tag directory for the appropriate naming convention.
    NOTE: If you are using SVN 1.5.x with Maven 2.0.8+, you may need to specify -Dusername=<svnusername> -Dpassword=<svn pass> -DtagBase=<url to tags dir>
    NOTE: If the task fails when attempting to produce the tag with a message saying a file already exists, then run 'svn up' and rerun 'mvn release:prepare'.
            This is a problem caused by a change in subversion breaking how the plugin worked.
5.1.  The invocation of mvn release:prepare may fail stating that the fhh-services test-jar module is not found for for the current version number, when and if this happens you need to perform an 'mvn clean install' to build local versions of the dependencies. This is a known issue with Maven and our configuration -- http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MJAR-68. 
6.  After #5 is completes successfully, run mvn release:perform
7.  Mark the version released in Jira.
