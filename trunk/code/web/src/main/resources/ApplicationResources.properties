help.learnMore.text.link.users=For Consumers & Practitioners
help.learnMore.text.h2.users=Questions & Answers for Consumers and Practitioners

help.learnMore.text.h4.whyUseful=Why is family health history useful?
help.learnMore.text.p1.whyUseful=Your family health history can help your health care practitioner provide better care for you.  It can help identify whether you have higher risk for some diseases.  It can help your health care practitioner recommend actions for reducing your personal risk of disease.  And it can help in looking for early warning signs of disease.

help.learnMore.text.h4.keyFeatures=What are the key features of the Surgeon General\'s family health history tool?
help.learnMore.text.p1.keyFeatures=The Surgeon General\'s \"My Family Health Portrait\" is an internet-based tool that makes it easy for you to record your family health history.  The tool is easy to access on the web and simple to fill out.  It assembles your information and makes a \"pedigree\" family tree that you can download.  It is private--it does not keep your information.  It gives you a health history that you can share with family members or send to your health care practitioner.

help.learnMore.text.h4.formLength=How long does it take to fill out the form?  What do I do with it then?
help.learnMore.text.p1.formLength=It should only take about 15 to 20 minutes to build a basic family health history.  Individuals with larger families will spend more time entering in their information.  Then you have the option of sharing it with other family members, if you wish.  They may help provide information you didn\'t know.  And relatives can start with your information and create their own history.  You will also probably want to provide your health history to your health care practitioner.  You and your health care practitioner should review it together before making it part of your medical record.

help.learnMore.text.h4.myPrivacy=What about my privacy? Does the government (or others, like my employer) have access to my information?
help.learnMore.text.p1.myPrivacy=The Surgeon General\'s My Family Health Portrait tool does NOT keep a government record of the information you fill in nor make your health information available to anyone else but you. It only provides the software for organizing your information. By accessing the tool on the web, you make use of that software. But the information you fill in is never available to anyone else, unless you choose to share or disclose it. After you fill in your information, it is available only to you for downloading. After that, it\'s up to you whether you want to share the information with other family members or provide it to your health care practitioner.

help.learnMore.text.h4.privacyHealthVault=What will be done to keep my information private and confidential on the Microsoft HealthVault website?
help.learnMore.text.p1.privacyHealthVault=The Microsoft Health account privacy statement is located here:
help.learnMore.text.p1.link.privacyHealthVault=http://www.healthvault.com/privacy-policy.html.
help.learnMore.text.p2.privacyHealthVault=Additional information about the terms of service can be reviewed here:
help.learnMore.text.p2.link.privacyHealthVault=http://www.healthvault.com/terms-of-use.html.

help.learnMore.text.h4.toolHelp=What if I need help in filling out the tool?
help.learnMore.text.p1.toolHelp=The tool should be easy to complete.
help.learnMore.text.p1.toolHelpMs=If you need help with this website, it is available from the Application Support Desk at the National Cancer Institute\'s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT). You can contact the CBIIT help desk by email at
help.learnMore.text.p1.toolHelpEmail=ncicb@pop.nci.nih.gov
help.learnMore.text.p1.toolHelpPhone=and by telephone at 888.478.4423 (toll free) or 301-451-4384.
help.learnMore.text.p1.toolHelpHours=The CBIIT help desk is open from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM Eastern time, but they can take recorded messages from 8:00 PM to 8:00 AM Eastern time. The help desk can assist you with problems with the tool, but questions about your health history or medical conditions should be referred to a qualified health professional.
help.learnMore.text.p1.msnote1=If you need assistance saving or copying your information to and from Microsoft HealthVault, do not contact Application Support!
help.learnMore.text.p1.msnote2=Instead direct questions to HealthVault Support at
help.learnMore.text.p1.msemail=http://support.microsoft.com/healthvault

help.learnMore.text.h4.whyReindex=Why is it important that the tool \"re-indexes\" as different family members use it?
help.learnMore.text.p1.whyReindex=If you share your family health history with a relative, they can use your information as a starting point to create their own family health history.  This is made even easier by re-indexing. \"Re-indexing\" means your relatives can make themselves the center of the information, start their own family health history, and the information that you provided is automatically readjusted to show its correct relationship to them.

help.learnMore.text.h4.encourageSharing=How can I encourage other family members to share their health information?
help.learnMore.text.p1.encourageSharing=Privacy is important, and no one should be forced to share personal health information if they don\'t wish to.  But knowledge of family health histories may be spread over different family members, so sharing can help create the best product.  Maybe the best way to encourage sharing is to help make it clear how this information can help health care practitioners provide better care and make more informed decisions.

help.learnMore.text.h4.securityPrecautions=What security precautions should I take when I share information with relatives?
help.learnMore.text.p1.securityPrecautions=Since the information that is aggregated by the FHH tool is personal health information, you should take reasonable precautions when sending this information to relatives. You should encrypt the information before sending it via email. If you don\'t have access to encrypted email; it may be better to transfer the information on a CD or memory stick; either in person or by regular mail.

help.learnMore.text.h4.familyKnowledge=What if my knowledge about my family health history is incomplete or imprecise?
help.learnMore.text.p1.familyKnowledge=Very few people are likely to have detailed and precise information about their family members/ health histories.  But any information can be helpful.  Once you have completed your history, it is important to talk about it with your health care practitioner.  He or she  may be able to help provide perspective, or even provide more detail based on the knowledge you bring.

help.learnMore.text.h4.ehrPhrReady=Why is it important that the tool is \"EHR- and PHR-ready\"?
help.learnMore.text.p1.ehrPhrReady=Electronic health records (EHRs) can help improve quality of care and improve cost-effectiveness of care at the same time.  With interoperable EHRs, your health information can be available when and where it is needed--whether in an emergency, or merely when seeing a new physician.  For EHRs to be useful, products like My Family Health Portrait need to be compatible and \"EHR-ready.\"  That way they can be embedded in EHRs (or in PHRs, the electronic \"personal health record\" maintained by the consumer).  The Surgeon General\'s family health history tool is ready for use in EHRs.

help.learnMore.text.h4.clinicalDecisionSupport=What is \"clinical decision support\"? How does it apply to family health history?
help.learnMore.text.p1.clinicalDecisionSupport=\"Clinical decision support\" refers to software tools that help health care practitioners deliver the best quality care.  These tools usually operate as a feature of EHRs.  For example, these tools can alert a practitioner to potentially dangerous drug interactions by automatically matching a new prescription with the drugs a patient is already taking.  Likewise the tools can remind a physician or consumer when certain procedures may be due.  Such tools can interact with your health history information and help in forming personalized health recommendations.

help.learnMore.text.h4.doctorsUse=Can doctors use information from the tool even if they don\'t have EHRs?
help.learnMore.text.p1.doctorsUse=Yes.  The most important goal is simply to record your information.  The Surgeon General\'s My Family Health Portrait tool can help you do that easily.  The information will be useful to you and your health care practitioner whether or not the practitioner uses electronic records yet.

help.learnMore.text.h4.giveAdvice=Will the family health history tool give me advice on actions I should take?
help.learnMore.text.p1.giveAdvice=No.  The Surgeon General\'s tool helps gather information that will be useful for you and your health care practitioner, but it does not provide medical advice.  You should consult with a health professional about advice based on your family health history information.

help.learnMore.text.h2.adopters=Questions & Answers for Organizations Considering Adopting The Tool for Their Own Use

help.learnMore.text.h4.adoptionMean=What does \"adoption\" mean?
help.learnMore.text.p1.adoptionMean=Organizations can adopt the tool under their own names and even customize it, while preserving its standards-based features.  The computer code that supports the Surgeon General\'s family health history tool is openly available, without charge or royalty.  The code can be downloaded by organizations and customized to their needs and purposes.  This includes offering the tool under an organization\'s own brand, without attribution to the Surgeon General tool.  In this way, it is hoped that many organizations will promote the gathering of family health history and the use of the new family health history tool

help.learnMore.text.h4.likelyAdopters=What kinds of organizations might be likely \"adopters\" of the tool and its code?
help.learnMore.text.p1.likelyAdopters=Many health plans already provide web-based portals for their customers, and many of them make their customers’ electronic personal health records securely available on-line.  They could offer their own version of the family health history tool to their customers as part of their suite of electronic information services.  Many health care payers also provide portals or websites where the tool could be included under their own brand.  Vendors who produce EHR and PHR products could build the tool into their products, possibly adding custom features.  Disease advocacy and patient-support groups could offer their own versions of the tool, customized to focus on areas of particular concern.  Others including health professional and pharmacy organizations, physician practices or other providers might wish to adopt and customize the tool.  Adopters may be commercial or non-commercial.

help.learnMore.text.h4.whyAdopt=Why might an organization want to become an adopter?
help.learnMore.text.p1.whyAdopt=Family health history is part of the foundation of good primary care.  The new tool makes the information easy to gather, easy to share, and ready for enhanced use in an EHR environment.  Further, family health history is especially important for identifying disease risk and supporting steps to reduce that risk or look for early disease signs.  All of these represent steps that improve quality of care and potentially reduce disease and its costs.  Finally, as the tool can be customized, different organizations can offer features that may be especially helpful to a given population, or that may represent a quality or competitive edge.

help.learnMore.text.h4.customizeTool=In what ways can adopters customize the tool and its code to better serve their particular purposes?
help.learnMore.text.p1.customizeTool=Aside from re-branding the tool under their own names, adopters might want to add enhanced information-gathering regarding particular diseases, links to other web-based services like risk-assessment tools or patient support, and features making the tool more compatible with the operations of the adopting entity.  However, adopters should avoid suggesting that this tool provides medical advice:  it is an information vehicle to help consumers and health professionals make health care decisions, not a source of advice.

help.learnMore.text.h4.adopterObligations=What obligations does an adopter agree to?
help.learnMore.text.p1.adopterObligationsPt1=While the tool can be customized, the core standards used in the tool and the resulting interoperability of the information it generates must be preserved.  This interoperability is at the heart of the value of the new tool.  As part of the code downloading process, adopters must accept an
help.learnMore.text.p1.adopterObligations.eua=End User Agreement
help.learnMore.text.p1.adopterObligationsPt2=to the effect that the core program architecture and data structure must be preserved such that the data generated by the software remains compatible with the original software.   In addition, customized products may not claim endorsement by HHS or the Surgeon General.

help.learnMore.text.h4.howtoProceed=How should an organization proceed if it is interested in adopting, or learning more about adoption?
help.learnMore.text.p1.howtoProceed=Those interested in adopting should proceed directly to the download site,
help.learnMore.text.p1.howtoProceed.url=http://gforge.nci.nih.gov/projects/fhh

help.learnMore.text.h4.adoptHelp=Is help available for those who wish to adopt the tool and its code?
help.learnMore.text.p1.adoptHelp=The downloading process is designed to be as easy as possible.  In addition, the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) maintains a help desk that is available to you.  The help desk may be reached at:

help.learnMore.text.p1.hipaaPrivacy.pdfReader=You will need a PDF reader in order to view the frequently asked questions PDF Above. Adobe Reader is a free PDF Reader.

help.learnMore.text.h4.interoperable=What existing standards have been adopted to make the tool interoperable and EHR-ready?
help.learnMore.text.p1.interoperable=In order to make the products of the My Family Health Portrait tool interoperable in an EHR environment, developers of the tool have used existing standards including the HL7 Family History Model, LOINC, SNOMED-CT and HL7 Vocabulary. In addition, the tool includes an applicable subset of information from the minimum core dataset for family health history as developed pursuant to recommendations by the American Health Information Community.

#/* --- PAGE: About This Site --- */
footer.about.title=About My Family Health Portrait
footer.about.text.p1=was originally developed in collaboration between the Office of the Surgeon General and the National Human Genome Research Institute, a part of the National Institutes of Health, Department of Health and Human Services. The first version of My Family Health Portrait was released in November 2004 as downloadable computer software. However, it ran only on computers using the Windows operating system, a significant disadvantage to users of Macintosh (Mac) operating systems.
footer.about.text.p2=In November 2005, the tool was released in a web-based version that uses an Internet browser on a user\'s personal computer. No software is downloaded to the user\'s personal computer, so the tool now works on a computer using the Macintosh operating system as well as a computer using the Windows operating system. The only requirement is that the user have an up-to-date version of their browser software, which is widely available from multiple sources. The software for My Family Health Portrait was tested in current versions of Internet Explorer for Windows, Firefox for Windows and Mac, Netscape for Windows and Mac and Safari for Mac.
footer.about.text.p3=In January 2009, the tool was re-architected and modified in the following ways:
footer.about.text.item1.standardsBased=Standards-based:
footer.about.text.item1=Leveraging work done by the American Health Information Community (AHIC), both technical and core data standards have been built into the FHH 2.0 design. This means an increase in interoperability and a diminished learning curve for consumers, practitioners and researchers.
footer.about.text.item2.shareable=Shareable:
footer.about.text.item2=Information can be electronically shared by the consumer with family members and healthcare providers. This new feature allows consumers to collaborate with family electronically to develop a more robust family health history record.
footer.about.text.item3.ehrReady=EHR-Ready:
footer.about.text.item3=Version 2.0 produces xml files that can be easily integrated into existing EHRs with little customization or IT support needed. It\'s as simple as copying an electronic file from one location into a new system.
footer.about.text.item4.customizable=Customizable:
footer.about.text.item4=The tool can be downloaded for adoption under an organization\'s own brand.  It  is intended to be easily adaptable into patient care portals, thus allowing healthcare organizations to promote family health history taking under their own brand, use it within their own secure environment, and contribute to comprehensive \"one-stop-shopping\" online patient service portal.

glossary.term.accidentalDeath=Accidental death
glossary.description.accidentalDeath=An accidental death happens as the result of an accident such as a car crash, drowning, or fire.

glossary.term.adhdAdd=Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder/Attention Deficit Disorder
glossary.description.adhdAdd=ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) is a problem with inattentiveness, over-activity, impulsivity or a combination of these and other symptoms. To be diagnosed with ADHD, symptoms must be out of the normal range for the child\'s age and development. Studies show the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of other children. These children handle neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin and adrenalin) differently from their peers. ADHD is, in most cases, genetic. ADHD is also sometimes known as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).

glossary.term.aids=AIDS
glossary.description.aids=AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). AIDS is the final and most serious stage of HIV, where there is severe damage to the immune system. By damaging or destroying the cells of a person\'s immune system, HIV interferes with the body\'s ability to effectively fight off viruses, bacteria and fungi that cause disease. This makes a person more susceptible to certain types of cancers and to opportunistic infections the body would normally resist. AIDS begins when the CD4 cell (or T-cell) count in an infected person\'s body is below 200. The most common ways AIDS is transmitted is through sexual contact (including oral, vaginal and anal sex), through blood (via blood transfusions) or needle sharing or from mother to child. A pregnant woman can transmit the virus to her fetus through their shared blood circulation, and a nursing mother can transmit AIDS to her baby in her milk.

glossary.term.alcoholism=Alcoholism
glossary.description.alcoholism=Alcoholism refers to any condition that results in the continued consumption of alcoholic beverages despite the health problems and negative social consequences it causes.

glossary.term.alzheimersDisease=Alzheimer\'s disease
glossary.description.alzheimersDisease=Alzheimer\'s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects a person\'s ability to carry out daily activities.

glossary.term.angina=Angina
glossary.description.angina=Angina is chest pain or discomfort as a result of the heart muscle not receiving enough blood or oxygen. Generally, angina may feel like pressure or a squeezing pain in the chest, but the pain may also occur in the shoulders, arms, neck, jaw, or back.

glossary.term.anorexiaNervosa=Anorexia Nervosa
glossary.description.anorexiaNervosa=Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by the fear of becoming obese, a distorted self-image, a persistent refusal to eat and severe weight loss. People with anorexia nervosa view themselves as overweight even when they are very thin. Anorexia nervosa often involves frequent vomiting (self-induced), excessive exercise, malnutrition, amenorrhea or other physiological changes. Unusual eating habits may include avoiding food and meals altogether, selecting few foods and eating them in small portions or carefully weighing and portioning food.

glossary.term.anxiety=Anxiety
glossary.description.anxiety=Fear and anxiety are part of life. You may feel anxious before you take a test or walk down a dark street. This kind of anxiety is useful - it can make you more alert or careful. It usually ends soon after you are out of the situation that caused it. But for millions of people in the United States, the anxiety does not go away, and gets worse over time. They may have chest pains or nightmares. They may even be afraid to leave home.

glossary.term.appendicitis=Appendicitis
glossary.description.appendicitis=Appendicitis is inflammation of the appendix, a small pouch located in the lower right abdomen and attached to the large intestine (or colon). Once the inflammation starts, it is considered a medical emergency since there is no effective medical therapy. If treatment is delayed, the appendix can burst, causing infection and even death. Most patients recover without difficulty or with minimal difficulty, when promptly treated. Removal of the appendix (appendectomy) appears to cause no change in digestive function.

glossary.term.arthritis=Arthritis
glossary.description.arthritis=Arthritis is inflammation of the joints and the breakdown of the cartilage that protects the joints. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, when walking or when performing other activities that require a person to bear weight. Without the usual amount of cartilage, the bones rub together, causing pain, swelling and stiffness. Common forms of arthritis are gout, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

glossary.term.asthma=Asthma
glossary.description.asthma=Asthma is a disease in which the airways of the lungs are tightened, inflamed or irritated. During normal breathing, air moves freely and airways are relaxed. With asthma, airflow is restricted and the airways are tightened. With less normal air supply, a person can feel short of breath, causing a whistling sound called wheezing. People with asthma usually have red, swollen airways, a condition considered to greatly contribute to long-term damage of the lungs.

glossary.term.autism=Autism
glossary.description.autism=Autism is a brain disorder that affects a person\'s ability to communicate and socially interact. It is also characterized by preoccupation with repetitive activities, excessive attachment to certain objects and short attention span.

#/* --- B --- */

glossary.term.bipolarDisorder=Bipolar Disorder
glossary.description.bipolarDisorder=Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it experience dramatic mood swings. They may go from overly energetic, \"high\" and/or irritable, to sad and hopeless, and then back again. They often have normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression.

glossary.term.bladderCancer=Bladder Cancer
glossary.description.bladderCancer=Bladder cancer is cancer of the organ located in the pelvic cavity that collects and holds urine until it exits your body. Signs or symptoms aren\'t usually detected in its early stages.

glossary.term.blodClots=Blood clots
glossary.description.blodClots=A blood clot is blood that has been changed from a liquid to a solid.  When this happens inside of a blood vessel it is also called a thrombus. Blood clots inside blood vessels can remain attached to their place in the blood vessel or they can move from that place through the bloodstream.  Sometimes these clots can block blood flow to important parts of the body such as the heart (heart attack), brain (stroke) or lungs (pulmonary embolism).   There are several conditions that can in run in families that make harmful blood clots more likely to form.

glossary.term.blotClotInLungsArms=Blood Clot in the lungs or arms (Pulmonary Embolism)
glossary.description.blotClotInLungsArms=A pulmonary embolism is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. The cause is usually a blood clot in the leg called a deep vein thrombosis that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lung. If a clot is large, or if there are many clots, pulmonary embolism can cause death.

glossary.term.blodClotInLegs=Blood Clot in the Legs (Deep Vein Thrombosis)
glossary.description.blodClotInLegs=Deep vein thrombosis, or DVT, is a blood clot that forms in a vein deep in the body. Most deep vein clots occur in the lower leg or thigh. If the vein swells, the condition is called thrombophlebitis. A deep vein thrombosis can break loose and cause a serious problem in the lung, called a pulmonary embolism, or a heart attack or stroke.

glossary.term.boneDisease=Bone Disease
glossary.description.boneDisease=Your bones help you move, give you shape and support your body. They are living tissues that rebuild constantly throughout your life. During childhood and your teens, your body adds new bone faster than it removes old bone. After about age 20, you can lose bone faster than you make bone.

glossary.term.breastCancer=Breast Cancer
glossary.description.breastCancer=Breast cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that begins in the cells of the breast. The disease occurs mostly in women, but can affect men as well. Breast cancer can spread to other tissues or organs in the body like lymph nodes, bone, liver, lungs and brain.

glossary.term.bulimia=Bulimia
glossary.description.bulimia=Bulimia is an eating disorder characterized by frequent binge eating followed by measures to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, the use of laxatives, dieting or fasting. Bulimia is usually accompanied by feelings of guilt, depression and self-condemnation.

#/* --- C --- */

glossary.term.cancer=Cancer
glossary.description.cancer=Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don\'t need them, and old cells don\'t die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren\'t cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.

glossary.term.cerebralPalsy=Cerebral Palsy
glossary.description.cerebralPalsy=Cerebral palsy is a group of disorders caused by brain damage occurring at or before birth. The disorders are caused by faulty development of, or damage to, motor areas in the brain that disrupts the brain\'s ability to control movement and posture. Symptoms of cerebral palsy include difficulty with fine motor tasks (such as writing or using scissors), difficulty with walking or maintaining balance, involuntary movements or speech disturbances.

glossary.term.chronicFatigueSyndrome=Chronic Fatigue Syndrome
glossary.description.chronicFatigueSyndrome=Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a syndrome usually accompanied by impairment in short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender lymph nodes, muscle or joint pain and headache unrelated to any preexisting medical condition. CFS is characterized as a debilitating and profound syndrome not alleviated by regular bed rest.

glossary.term.chronicLowerRespiratoryDisease=Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease
glossary.description.chronicLowerRespiratoryDisease=Chronic lower respiratory diseases affect the lower part of the respiratory tract including the lungs. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and chronic bronchitis are examples of chronic lower respiratory disease.

glossary.term.copd=Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
glossary.description.copd=Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) makes it hard for you to breathe. Coughing up mucus is often the first sign of COPD. Chronic bronchitis and emphysema are common COPDs. Cigarette smoking is the most common cause of COPD. Breathing in other kinds of irritants, like pollution, dust or chemicals, may also cause or contribute to COPD.

glossary.term.cirrhosis=Cirrhosis
glossary.description.cirrhosis=Cirrhosis is a chronic disease of the liver characterized by the replacement of normal tissue with fibrous scar tissue. When scar tissue replaces normal tissue, blood flow through the liver is blocked. Blockage prevents the liver from working properly and can result in the loss of functional liver cells. Though cirrhosis has many causes, alcoholism and hepatitis C are identified as the most common causes.

glossary.term.colonCancer=Colon Cancer
glossary.description.colonCancer=Colon cancer or colorectal cancer is a malignant (cancerous) tumor that begins in cells of the colon or rectum. Colon cancer can spread to other tissues or organs in the body like the lymph nodes, liver, lungs and brain.

glossary.term.colonicPolyps=Colonic polyps
glossary.description.colonicPolyps=A polyp is an extra piece of tissue that grows inside your body. Colonic polyps grow in the large intestine, or colon. Most polyps are not dangerous. However, some polyps may turn into cancer or already be cancer. To be safe, doctors remove polyps and test them.

glossary.term.crohnsDisease=Crohn\'s disease
